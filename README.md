#DITA Migration Guide

This project is an experiment in information 
sharing and development inspired by the OASIS DITA Adoption
Listening Sessions conducted in 2016 and 2017. 

Specifically, this project focuses on providing a combination of 
overview information, learning resources, and community-driven 
use case descriptions for the following phases in a typical DITA migration:

- *Research*: Teams need to learn enough about DITA technology, financials, and show-stoppers to be able to develop a DITA migration proposal to their local management.
- *Implementation*: Teams need to implement enough of a DITA infrastructure in order to refactor and convert their content into some basic DITA pilot and/or production projects. 
- *Consolidation*: Teams need exploit (within reason) all the out-of-the-box and customizable features in DITA in order to consolidate and justify their investments in it as their default production pipeline.
- *Collaboration*: Teams need to understand where they can reasonably expect DITA to integrate with other content development tools, standards, and processes commonly seen in Enterprise organizations.
