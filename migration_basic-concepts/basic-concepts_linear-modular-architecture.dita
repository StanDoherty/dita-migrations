            <p class="- topic/p ">For a variety of reasons, the technical publishing industry does
                not have crisp, generally accepted set of definitions for linear and modular
                authoring environments. That said, the following definitions will suffice. </p>

         <title>Linear authoring environments </title>
            <p class="- topic/p ">Linear authoring environments consist of markup languages,
                authoring tools, and processors optimized for the development of publications
                designed to be read progressively (chapter-to-chapter, page-to-page,
                section-to-section). Distinguishing features include the following.</p>

                <li class="- topic/li ">
                    <p class="- topic/p ">Sophisticated book-oriented assembly logic, e.g. prelims,
                        part separators, chapter separators, et al..</p>

                <li class="- topic/li ">
                    <p class="- topic/p ">Style-driven, hierarchical organization, e.g. dedicated
                        elements/styes for each heading level. </p>

         <title>Modular authoring environments </title>
            <p class="- topic/p ">Modular authoring environments consist of markup languages,
                authoring tools, and processors optimized for the development of content
                repositories full of reusable information components. Publications built from these
                reusable components can be organized statically (with hardwired maps) or dynamically
                (with metadata-driven processors). Distinguishing features include the
                following.</p>
            <ul id="ul_hrj_3h2_ly" class="- topic/ul ">

                        The same set of modules and/or maps can generate multiple deliverables, each

     <section id="section_gcc_mj2_ly" class="- topic/section ">
            <p class="- topic/p ">There are no absolutes. If you apply best practices for modular writing to a linear
                authoring environment such as MS Word or unstructured Framemaker, you can produce
                some robust modular help systems. Similarly, authors in a modular environment can
                assemble and link modules into respectable linear manuals. That said, there is more
                logic and tooling in modular environments to produce linear documentation than there
                is logic and tooling in the linear environment to produce robust modular
                documentation. </p>
